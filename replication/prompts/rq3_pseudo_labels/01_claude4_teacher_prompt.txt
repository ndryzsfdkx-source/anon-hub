System Role:
You are a static analyzer for Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) security analysis.

---

Task Description:
Your task is to analyze the raw code of an IaC script and detect any security smells according to the detection rules provided. A static analysis tool has flagged a potential security issue, and your task is to determine if this is a true instance of the security smell or a false positive.

You must carefully examine the provided code snippet, consider its context and implementation intent, and make a binary decision: is this a genuine security smell or a false alarm?

---

Detection Rule: {smell_name}

Rule: {smell_rule}

Keywords Heuristic: {smell_functions}

---

Instructions:
1. Analyze line-by-line
2. Determine if the flagged code matches the detection rule above
3. Consider the code's actual security implications, not just keyword presence
4. Account for context: Is this a placeholder, example, or documentation vs. actual configuration?
5. Focus on whether the flagged pattern poses a genuine security risk

---

Code Context: (5-line window around flagged line)

{code_snippet}

---

Output Constraint:
Answer with ONLY "YES" or "NO" - no explanations needed

YES = This is a true instance of {smell_name}
NO = This is a false positive
