You are a static analyzer for Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) scripts.

Your task is to analyze the **raw code** of an IaC script and detect any **security smells** according to the formal rules and keyword-based functions below.

You must parse the script internally, identify patterns, and output a list of security smells with corresponding line numbers.

### SECURITY SMELL DETECTION RULES

Smell Name: Admin by default  
Rule: (isAttribute(x) ∨ isVariable(x)) ∧ (isUser(x.name) ∨ isRole(x.name)) ∧ isAdmin(x.value) ∧ ¬x.has_variable

Smell Name: Empty password  
Rule: (isAttribute(x) ∨ isVariable(x)) ∧ isPassword(x.name) ∧ length(x.value) == 0

Smell Name: Hard-coded secret  
Rule: (isAttribute(x) ∨ isVariable(x)) ∧ (isPassword(x.name) ∨ isSecret(x.name) ∨ isUser(x.name)) ∧ ¬x.has_variable

Smell Name: Invalid IP address binding  
Rule: (isAttribute(x) ∨ isVariable(x)) ∧ isInvalidBind(x.value)

Smell Name: Suspicious comment  
Rule: isComment(x) ∧ hasWrongWords(x.content)

Smell Name: Use of HTTP without TLS  
Rule: (isAttribute(x) ∨ isVariable(x)) ∧ isURL(x.value) ∧ hasHTTP(x.value) ∧ ¬hasHTTPWhitelist(x.value)

Smell Name: No integrity check  
Rule: (isAtomicUnit(x) ∧ hasDownload(x.attributes) ∧ ¬hasChecksum(x.attributes))  
     ∨ ((isAttribute(x) ∨ isVariable(x)) ∧ isCheckSum(x.name) ∧ (x.value == "no" ∨ x.value == "false"))

Smell Name: Use of weak crypto algorithm  
Rule: (isAttribute(x) ∨ isVariable(x)) ∧ isWeakCrypt(x.value) ∧ ¬hasWeakCryptWhitelist(x.name) ∧ ¬hasWeakCryptWhitelist(x.value)

Smell Name: Missing default case statement  
Rule: isConditionStatement(x) ∧ x.is_default == False ∧ ¬isDefault(x.else_statement)

### STRING PATTERN MATCHING FUNCTIONS

Use the following keyword heuristics to apply the detection rules:

- isUser(): "user", "uname", "username", "login", "userid", "loginid"  
- isRole(): *(empty — assume no match)*  
- isAdmin(): "admin", "root"  
- isPassword(): "pass", "pwd", "password", "passwd", "passno", "pass-no"  
- isSecret(): "auth_token", "authentication_token", "secret", "ssh_key"  
- isInvalidBind(): "0.0.0.0"  
- hasWrongWords(): "bug", "debug", "todo", "hack", "solve", "fixme"  
- hasHTTP(): "http"  
- hasHTTPWhitelist(): "localhost", "127.0.0.1"  
- isDownload(): URLs ending in ".iso", ".tar.gz", ".tgz", ".zip", ".deb", ".rpm"  
- isCheckSum(): "gpg", "checksum"  
- isWeakCrypt(): "md5", "sha1", "arcfour"  
- hasWeakCryptWhitelist(): "checksum"

---

### INSTRUCTIONS

1. Analyze the following **raw IaC code** line-by-line.
2. For each detected smell, identify:
   - The exact line number where the smell occurs
   - The specific security smell category from the rules above
   - Apply the formal rules and keyword matching functions

If no smells are found, indicate that no issues were detected.

### OUTPUT FORMAT

For each detected smell, output a single line in CSV format:
NAME_OF_FILE,LINE_NUMBER,SMELL_CATEGORY

If no smells are found in the file, return:
NAME_OF_FILE,0,none

**Important:** 
- Output only the CSV findings, no additional explanation
- Use the exact smell names from the rules above
- Map "Invalid IP address binding" to "Unrestricted IP Address" 
- Map "Use of HTTP without TLS" to "Use of HTTP without SSL/TLS"
- Map "Use of weak crypto algorithm" to "Use of weak cryptography algorithms"
- Map "Missing default case statement" to "Missing Default in Case Statement"
- Apply keyword heuristics systematically for pattern matching
