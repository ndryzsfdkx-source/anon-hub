You are an expert in Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) security analysis.

Your task is to analyze the **raw code** of an IaC script and detect any **security smells** according to the definitions and patterns described below.

You must parse the script internally, identify patterns, and output a list of security smells with corresponding line numbers.

---

### SECURITY SMELL DEFINITIONS

1. **Admin by default**: This smell is the recurring pattern of specifying default users as administrative users. The smell can violate the "principle of least privilege" property. We can consider this smell every time more privileges are being given than it should be necessary.

2. **Empty password**: This smell is the recurring pattern of using a string of length zero for a password. An empty password is indicative of a weak password.

3. **Hard-coded secret**: This smell is the recurring pattern of revealing sensitive information, such as user name and passwords in IaC scripts. We consider three types of hard-coded secrets: hard-coded passwords, hard-coded user names, and hard-coded private cryptography keys.

4. **Missing Default in Case Statement**: This smell is the recurring pattern of not handling all input combinations when implementing a case conditional logic.

5. **No integrity check**: This smell is the recurring pattern of downloading content from the Internet and not checking the downloaded content using checksums or gpg signatures. Simply referencing or defining a URL does not count unless an actual download is performed without validation.

6. **Suspicious comment**: This smell is the recurring pattern of putting information in comments about the presence of defects, missing functionality, or weakness of the system. Examples of such comments include putting keywords such as "TODO," "FIXME," and "HACK" in comments.

7. **Unrestricted IP Address**: This smell is the recurring pattern of assigning the address 0.0.0.0 for a database server or a cloud service/instance. Binding to the address 0.0.0.0 may cause security concerns as this address can allow connections from every possible network.

8. **Use of HTTP without SSL/TLS**: This smell is the recurring pattern of using HTTP without the Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Such use makes the communication between two entities less secure, as without SSL/TLS, use of HTTP is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. Do not flag http:// URLs that use local addresses like localhost, 127.0.0.1, or ::1, as these are not security risks.

9. **Use of weak cryptography algorithms**: This smell is the recurring pattern of using weak cryptography algorithms, namely, MD5 and SHA-1, for encryption purposes.

### INSTRUCTIONS

1. Analyze the following **raw IaC code** line-by-line.
2. For each detected smell, identify:
   - The exact line number where the smell occurs
   - The specific security smell category from the definitions above
   - The problematic code pattern

If no smells are found, indicate that no issues were detected.

### RAW CODE INPUT

**Analyzing file: openstack@puppet-monasca-manifests-virtualenv-instance.pp (Puppet)**


Line 1: # == Define: virtualenv::instance
Line 2: #
Line 3: # This class will manage the installation of the monasca agent into a Python
Line 4: # virtualenv.  It will also manage the config files needed by that software,
Line 5: # with different policies for packages and virtualenvs.  By default the config
Line 6: # files will be copied from the template files internal to the module.  This
Line 7: # behavior can be overridden by providing a $config_files hash.
Line 8: #
Line 9: # Virtualenv installations are built by installing packages from a given
Line 10: # requirements.txt file. For production use you will normally want to override
Line 11: # the requirements.txt and provide one that contains pinned module versions,
Line 12: # and possibly include information about a local pypi mirror in the
Line 13: # requirements.txt.
Line 14: #
Line 15: # This module explicitly supports provisioning multiple virtualenv based
Line 16: # installations in order to make upgrades and rollbacks easier.  To take
Line 17: # advantage of this, you can define additional instances of
Line 18: # monasca::virtualenv::instance type with the active flag set to false
Line 19: # and with different $venv_prefix options.  The monasca::agent class will allow
Line 20: # configuring multiple virtualenvs via hiera.
Line 21: #
Line 22: # If using virtualenv based installations it's *strongly* recommended that
Line 23: # virtualenvs be treated as immutable once created.  Behavior with changing
Line 24: # requirements.txt or code may not be what you expect, since the existing
Line 25: # virtualenv will be updated, not rebuilt when requirements.txt or the git
Line 26: # revision changes.
Line 27: #
Line 28: # === Parameters
Line 29: #
Line 30: # [*ensure*] (required) Whether or not the package should be removed or
Line 31: # installed.  Should be 'present', or 'absent'. For package installs, other
Line 32: # values such as a version number or 'latest' are also acceptable.
Line 33: #
Line 34: # [*venv_active*] (optional) Whether or not the virtualenv should be made
Line 35: # active by managing symlinks into it and restarting services if the links are
Line 36: # changed.  Only one virtualenv can be active at a time.  Defaults to false.
Line 37: #
Line 38: # [*basedir*] (required) Base directory for storing virtualenvs.
Line 39: #
Line 40: # [*symlink*] (required if venv_active is true) The path to link to the venv_dir
Line 41: #
Line 42: # [*venv_prefix*] Prefix to give to virtualenv directories
Line 43: # This can be specified to provide more meaningful names, or to have multiple
Line 44: # virtualenvs installed at the same time. Defaults to $name
Line 45: #
Line 46: # [*venv_requirements*] (required) Python requirements.txt to pass to pip when
Line 47: # populating the virtualenv.  Required if the instance is ensured to be present.
Line 48: #
Line 49: # [*venv_extra_args*] (optional) Extra arguments that will be passed to `pip
Line 50: # install` when creating the virtualenv.

### OUTPUT FORMAT

For each detected smell, output a single line in CSV format:
NAME_OF_FILE,LINE_NUMBER,SMELL_CATEGORY

If no smells are found in the file, return:
NAME_OF_FILE,0,none

**Important:** 
- Output only the CSV findings, no additional explanation
- Use the exact smell names from the definitions above
- Focus on identifying actual security vulnerabilities, not potential issues
- Be precise with line number identification
